🎯 Project Goals

This scoreboard is part of a hands-on learning journey through Scrimba’s curriculum. It reflects a disciplined approach to UI design, modular JavaScript logic, and creative problem-solving. Built from scratch using trial-and-error CSS and reused logic patterns from previous projects like a stopwatch and rock-paper-scissors game.
