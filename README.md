 Buttons for +1, +2, +3, and foul (-1) per team, each with unique IDs for modular JS control.

 Toggle button allows the timer to pause and resume seamlessly during gameplay.

🎯 Project Goals

This scoreboard is part of a hands-on learning journey through Scrimba’s curriculum. It reflects a disciplined approach to UI design, modular JavaScript logic, and creative problem-solving. Built from scratch using trial-and-error CSS and reused logic patterns from previous projects like a stopwatch and rock-paper-scissors game.

Recent enhancements include:
• Semantic HTML tags (header, main, section) for better accessibility and structure  
• Separation of logic from markup using addEventListener  
• Full game control features: countdown timer, pause/resume, foul limits, and reset functionality
